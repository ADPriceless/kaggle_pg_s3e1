# kaggle_pg_s3e1
## Summary
- Kaggle playground Season 3 Ex 1: California Housing
- The objective is to predict the value of a house

## Thanks to OpenStreetMap
- Coastline data was used in this project from OpenStreetMap: https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/coastlines.html
- The data used is available under the Open Database License: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright
- The PNG of California was also downloaded from OpenStreetMap: https://www.openstreetmap.org

## Further Work
- Try rotating the latitude and longitude data (since this may help the a tree based estimator to separate the data)
- Try to embed the latitude and longitude in a higher dimensional space to help the estimator separate the data
- Model selection to find a better estimator and/or better hyperparameters for the estimator
